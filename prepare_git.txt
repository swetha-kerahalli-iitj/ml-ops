For my WSL setup, sshkeys were suddenly stopping to work suddenly, again and again.

The problem:
ssh -T git@github.com

git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).


Solution: It seems to be some problem with ssh-agent, simply re-adding my sshkeys to agent seem to  solving the issue. And, I did not have to add public keys to my github profile.

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/tidhamecha2-2
ssh -T git@github.com
Hi tidhamecha2! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

1. Take classification example from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_digits_classification.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-classification-plot-digits-classification-py

2. Create a new repo and add this example to it
3. Create necessary requirements.txt file and push to the repo.
4. How would you ensure that code would indeed work on other machines?

setting up some linux-like environment (native linux installation, wsl, virtual box but not gitbash or cygwin)
github ssh keys setup https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection
I will be asking randomly few folks to show the output of `ssh -T git@github.com` as a test of ssh key set up




Github getting started commands:

Fork repo https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/get-started-python

git clone https://github.com/tidhamecha2/get-started-python.git
<change the "tidhamecha2" to your github id>
git clone https://github.com/swetha-kerahalli-iitj/ml-ops/get-started-python.git
<make changes to some files>

git add <that changed file>
git commit -m "some meaningful message"
git push

Go to github and check if the commit is reflected there or not?
